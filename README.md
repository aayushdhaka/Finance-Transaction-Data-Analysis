## 🧾 Dataset Description
The dataset contains simulated financial transactions with the following attributes:
- Transaction ID
- Date
- Account Type
- Transaction Type (Debit / Credit)
- Category
- Amount (EUR)
- Payment Method
- Balance After Transaction

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Google Sheets (Pivot Tables, KPIs)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- GitHub for version control

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and validation
- Income vs Expense analysis
- Monthly spending trend analysis
- Category-wise expense breakdown
- High-value transaction identification
- KPI calculations (Total Income, Expense, Net Balance)

---

## 📓 Jupyter Notebook
The notebook `Finance_Transaction_Analysis.ipynb` contains:
- Data loading and validation
- Feature engineering (Month, Year, Cash Flow)
- Income vs Expense calculations
- KPI computation (Total Income, Total Expense, Net Balance)

## 📊 Key Insights
- A small number of categories contribute to a large portion of total expenses.
- High-value transactions account for a significant share of total spending.
- Certain months show noticeably higher expenses, indicating seasonal patterns.
- Overall expenses exceed income, highlighting potential overspending risk.

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Introduce monthly expense monitoring, especially during high-spending periods.
- Set alert thresholds for high-value transactions.
- Focus cost optimization on top expense categories.
- Track net balance regularly to prevent overspending.
